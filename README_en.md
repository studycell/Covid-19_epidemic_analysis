# Covid-19 epidemic data analysis

This project is used to analyze the data of the Covid-19 epidemic, perform data visualization operations on it, and use the SIR prediction model to predict future epidemic data.



##  Data Description

The data obtained in this project is derived from the Covid-19 epidemic crawler.

Some of the API which provides the data have stopped updating in 2020.
